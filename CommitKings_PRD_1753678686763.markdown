2. **Profile/Repo Rating**:
   - Display a random GitHub profile or repository, with priority given to profiles/repos from the predefined list when no other algorithmic data is available.
   - Show a contribution graph for the past year, including public and private contributions (similar to the provided image) for profiles.
   - For repositories, highlight key metrics (total PRs, closed PRs, open pull requests, issues, stars, contributors) in an eye-catching manner using bold colors (e.g., green for stars, red for open issues).
   - Two buttons: ðŸ”¥ Hotty (positive rating) and ðŸ§Š Notty (negative rating).
   - Store ratings in Supabase database.
   - Prevent duplicate ratings from the same user for the same profile/repo.
3. **Leaderboard**:
   - Display top-rated profiles and repos based on Hotty/Notty scores.
   - Separate leaderboards for profiles and repositories.
   - Filterable by time (e.g., all-time, weekly).
   - Highlight "Profile/Repo of the Week" on the landing page once sufficient traffic and ratings are available, showcasing top leaderboard entries with visually appealing designs.
4. **Profile/Repo Details**:
   - Show basic GitHub info (e.g., username, bio, repo name, description, stars, forks).
   - Include a contribution graph for profiles (932 contributions in the last year as an example).
   - For repos, display total PRs, closed PRs, open pull requests, issues, stars, and contributors count with bold, colorful styling to draw attention.
   - Link to the original GitHub profile/repo.
5. **Open-Source Contribution**:
   - Public GitHub repository with clear documentation.
   - CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, and setup guides for local development.
   - Issue templates and pull request guidelines.
6. **Priority Rating and Search**:
   - Implement an algorithm to prioritize displaying profiles and repos from the predefined list (see Section 3.3) when insufficient rating data is available to drive algorithmic suggestions.
   - Allow users to search for profiles by GitHub username or repos by name, with priority given to the predefined list.
   - Landing page will feature prioritized profiles and repos from the predefined list, transitioning to top leaderboard entries (e.g., Profile/Repo of the Week) as traffic and ratings increase, ensuring eye-catching and visually appealing presentation.

### 3.2 Additional Features
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for specific profiles/repos to rate.
- **User Dashboard**: View personal rating history and contributions.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme toggle using shadcn/ui components.

### 3.3 Predefined Priority List
The following profiles and repositories will be prioritized for display on the landing page and in random selections when insufficient rating data is available to drive algorithmic suggestions. As traffic and ratings increase, the landing page will transition to showcasing top leaderboard entries (e.g., Profile/Repo of the Week) with visually appealing designs.
